  [ Chris Lamb ]

  * Optimisations:
    - Avoid multiple iterations over archive by unpacking once for an ~8X
      runtime optimisation.
    - Avoid unnecessary splitting and interpolating for a ~20X optimisation
      when writing --text output.
    - Avoid expensive diff regex parsing until we need it, speeding up diff
      parsing by 2X.
    - Alias expensive Config() in diff parsing lookup for a 10% optimisation.

  * Progress bar:
    - Show filenames, ELF sections, etc. in progress bar.
    - Emit JSON on the status file descriptor output instead of a custom
      format.

  * Logging:
    - Use more-Pythonic logging functions and output based on __name__, etc.
    - Use Debian-style "I:", "D:" log level format modifier.
    - Only print milliseconds in output, not microseconds.
    - Print version in debug output so that saved debug outputs can standalone
      as bug reports.

  * Profiling:
    - Also report the total number of method calls, not just the total time.
    - Report on the total wall clock taken to execute diffoscope, including
      cleanup.

  * Tidying:
    - Rename "NonExisting" -> "Missing".
    - Entirely rework diffoscope.comparators module, splitting as many separate
      concerns into a different utility package, tidying imports, etc.
    - Split diffoscope.difference into diffoscope.diff, etc.
    - Update file references in debian/copyright post module reorganisation.
    - Many other cleanups, etc.

  * Misc:
    - Clarify comment regarding why we call python3(1) directly. Thanks to
      Jérémy Bobbio <lunar@debian.org>.
    - Raise a clearer error if trying to use --html-dir on a file.
    - Fix --output-empty when files are identical and no outputs specified.
    - Wrap changelog line to avoid Lintian warning.

  [ Chris Lamb ]
  * Avoid unpacking packages twice when comparing .changes. (Closes: #843531)
  * Add a simple profiling framework (enabled via --profile) which tracks:
    - Container extraction, opening and closing times.
    - The "compare_files" top-level/recursive method.
    - The time taken to produce the various output formats.
    - All "has_same_content_as" and "recognizes" methods.
    - External commands that wrap "@tool_required".
    - External commands that use "make_feeder_from_command".
    - The internal/external "cmp" methods.
    - Some manual calls to subprocess.check_output().
  * Tidy log messages:
    * Clarify the meaning of the compare_files and Binary.has_same_content
      debug messages.
    * Skip low-value "X is already specialized" message.
    * Correct "instantiating" typo.

    - Correct `source` attribute of lsattr-based Difference instances.
    - Add comment regarding why difficult to optimise calls to lsattr
  * Internally guarantee to all progress observers that we will be processing
    something.
  * bin/diffoscope:
    - Ensure that running from Git always uses that checkout's modules.
    - Use os.path.join "properly" as we are already using it.
    - Use typical sys.path.insert(0, ...) method to modify sys.path.
    - Use immutable tuple over mutable list for clarity.
  * comparators.debian: No need to keep .buildinfo file descriptor open.
  * Suggest command-line for signing of PyPI uploads.
  * Improve documentation of new tests/conftest.py file.

  [ Maria Glukhova ]
  * Remove test data causing problems during build with Python 3.4.

diffoscope (63) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Add myself to Uploaders.
  * Greatly improve speed for large archives by fixing O(n^2) complexity for
    archive member lookup.
    - There is still O(n^2) complexity for archive member extraction, but this
      is less noticeable for various reasons and would require more complexity
      to fix, so for now is left as a task for the future.
  * Text output: add coloured diff support via colordiff(1).
  * Html-dir output: add +/- buttons to fold sub-diffs (i.e. toggle their
    visibility) as well as the whole diff itself. As with similar features in
    other programs, the effect affects all descendants if you shift-click.

  * Improve --help text and group the optional arguments based on topic.
  * Add a script to check sizes of dependencies.
  * tests/basic-command-line: check exit code and use a more complex example.
  * Provide better advice about what environment variable to set to make the
    console work.

diffoscope (60) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Chris Lamb ]
  * debian/rules:
    +  Run tests with python3-coverage and generate reports post-build.
  * CONTRIBUTING: Add PyPI reference.
  * Comparators:
    + Avoid ugly DRY violations in diffoscope.comparators.__init__ by
      dynamically importing classes via a single list.
    + git: Specify paths as strings as required since b7830b5cb.
    + elf:
      - Mask more warnings (eg. "readelf: Error: the dynamic segment offset" or
        "size exceeds the size of the file").
      - Specify string format arguments as logging function parameters, not
        using interpolation.
    + json: Correct behaviour of JSON comparator when file does not exist.
  * Presenters:
    + html:
      - Use html.escape over xml.sax.saxutils.escape.
      - Don't use unsafe cgi.escape method as its ``quote`` kwarg — which
        enables escaping of quotation marks — is False by default.
  * Code clean-up:
    + Tidy imports.
    + Split exceptions out into dedicated diffoscope.exc module.
    + Use try-except idiom instead of ``if`` in RequiredToolNotFound.get_package
    + Prefer kwargs[x] = kwargs.pop(x, 'default') idiom over ``if`` statements.
  * tests:
    + Factor out ugly os.path.join to a utility method.
    + Drop unused try_except in tests/conftest.
    + Add GitIndex tests to bring coverage of comparators/git.py to 100%.
    + Add tests for Haskell comparator.
      - Skip Haskell tests if GHC is not installed.
      - Skip Haskell tests if GHC version does not match.  Closes: #835055
    + Add test in JSON comparator for non-existing files.
    + Rewrite lengthy "[..] skipIf [..] tool_missing" with a
      @skip_unless_tools_exist decorator.
    + Add tests for skip_unless_tools_exist helper.
    + Rename tests/comparators/conftest.py -> tests/comparators/utils.py.
    + Avoid Don't-Repeat-Yourself violations by factoring out fixture loading.
    + Avoid more DRY violations by factoring-out non-existing file tests.
    + Remove some other unused imports from comparator tests.
    + Check rendering of text and HTML presenters when checking non-existing
      files.
    + Use `pytest.xfail` over `assert False`.

  [ Mattia Rizzolo ]
  * debian/control:
    + Reinstated build profiles, now that dh-python is fixed (see #834238).
    + Version the build-dependency on dh-python, so it supports build profiles.
    + Add more nocheck build profiles.
    + Bump dependencies on debhelper and dpkg-dev to assure build profile
      support is available.
    + Add Build-Dependency on fontforge-extras for showttf (run during tests)
    + Alternate Build-Dependency on default-jdk-headless|default-jdk, to ease
      backporting to older Debian releases.
  * debian/rules:
    + Don't install '/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/.coverage'.
    + Run the basic-command-line test during package build.
    + Be even more verbose about failing tests.
    + Allow building a mismatching version between diffoscope and the debian
      changelog if the target distribution is UNRELEASED.
  * Comparators
    + ppu:
      - Unbreak ppu_version detection.
      - Put code out of the context manager, it doesn't need to be within.
  * trydiffoscope: add copyright/license header.
  * autopkgtest/basic-command-line:
    + Enable running basic-command-line test without ADTTMP being set.
    + Be a bit more verbose about what is being tested.
    + Also test return code when passing an invalid command line flag.
    + Force LC_ALL=C.UTF-8, so that diffoscope can always output something.
  * test:
    + Factor out a tools_missing() function.
    + Rewrite tool_older_than() into skip_unless_tool_is_older_than().
    + Skip test_squashfs.py.test_superblock if squashfs is too old.
    + Normalize xxd's output so that we can compare jessie's xxd with stretch's.
  * add default-jdk to the alternate packages for javap for Debian;
    default-jdk-headless is not available in older Debian releases.

  [ Satyam Zode ]
  * Ignore differences in .buildinfo if all the other files listed in .changes
    are identical.  In those cases any differences in .buildinfo files are
    irrelevant, and are actually a feature (as it indicates two reproducible
    builds with different environment).

  [ Jérémy Bobbio ]
  * Properly skip tests requiring python-debian when unavailable.

  [ Ximin Luo ]
  * Show the timestamp when logging, to detect which steps take longer.
  * Add a --no-max flag to disable all limits.
  * Have --max-report-size honour 0 to mean "no limit".
  * Comparators:
    + cbfs: only scan whole file when the filename ends with ".rom".
    + binary: Suppress decimal line numbers for xxd output.
  * Increase default --max-diff-input-lines to 2^20 (1048576) from 100000.
  * Rename --no-max-limits to --no-default-limits, a more accurate name.
  * presenters/html: html-dir output:
    + Split large diffs across several child pages.
      Also add some flags so html-dir behaviour is easier to reason about.
    + Use 4 times the given --max-diff-block-lines.
      This way, '--html x.html --html-dir y' gives reasonable output for both.
  * difference:
    + Fix behaviour for max-diff-block-limit=1 and don't report when 0 lines
      are removed.
    + Don't truncate diff output by default, instead add a separate flag
      --max-diff-block-lines-saved (infinite by default) to do so.

  [ Chris Lamb ]
  * SquashFS test_testing:
    - Don't assume that user and group are 5 characters long in squashfs
      test_listing.
    - Drop test; simply too unreliable and/or has too many requirements to
      satisfy (eg. shorter usernames) for it to not be skipped.
  * Difference class:
    - Ensure that we pass str instances to our Difference class as paths,
      otherwise we can't be sure we can render them. For example, passing a
      class here breaks the HTML renderer.
    - Add test for type checking of path1/path2/source.
    - Pass a str for the path in the JSON comparator, fixing the HTML reporting
      of JSON output.
  * When looping over JQUERY_SYSTEM_LOCATIONS, actually use the variable we are
    looping with when performing the symlink(2) call.
  * trydiffoscope:
    - Add manpage for trydiffoscope.
    - Write trydiffoscope console output as UTF-8, even if STDOUT claims it
      doesn't support it.
  * debian/rules:
    - Make separate calls to dh_python3 for diffoscope and trydiffoscope to
      avoid both getting the same Recommends substvar.
    - Use a pattern-based rule for rst2man-based manpages instead of
      hard-coding "diffoscope.1".
    - Dynamically calculate manpages to generate over hardcoding.
  * .gitignore: Ignore all generated manpages, not just diffoscope.1.

  [ Holger Levsen ]
  * ./CONTRIBUTING:
    - Add new file.
    - Explain what to look out for when uploading diffoscope.

diffoscope (58) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Shorten Description of trydiffoscope to appease Lintian.
  * Make squashfs test_listing test more robust:
    - Add ".in" suffix to squashfs listing expected diff as we are about to
      template it properly.
    - Replace $USER with the current user with uid 1000.
    - Move test_listing replacements to a loop so we can easily add more.
    - Don't assume that the test environment as 4 CPUs in squashfs.test_listing
    - Don't assume default group is the same name as the user in test_listing.

  [Chris Lamb]
  * Add myself to Uploaders.
  * Add try.diffoscope.org command-line client in new binary package
    "trydiffoscope" to save installation of dependencies:
    - Open files in binary mode to support comparing binary files.
    - Optionally open URL in web browser.
    - Optionally poll locally until result is available.
    - Move to version 2 of API, don't continue to poll on error.
    - Correct and improve help text.
  * Code cleanups:
    - Tidy PROVIDERS dict in diffoscope/__init__.py.
    - Tidy OS_NAMES dict.
    - Correct indentation levels in various files.
    - Drop unused imports.
    - platform.get_linux_distribution() will break in Python 3.7.
    - Don't name first argument of Difference.from_command "cls" as it's not a
      classmethod.
    - comparators/directory.py: Call logger.warning over logger.warn.
    - Rename diffoscope.__main__ to diffoscope.main as its not a "real" magic
      name.
    - Raise NotImplementedError() instances over NotImplemented classes.
    - Add short option for trydiffoscope --url.
    - Rewrite trydiffoscope to match diffoscope's command-line API.
    - Use keepalive in trydiffoscope client to avoid new HTTP requests.
    - Highlight lines via HTML/CSS when hovering over a line to make it easier
      to visually track.
    - Rename debian/install -> debian/diffoscope.install now we have multiple
      binary packages.
  * Add a JSON comparator.
    - Add tests for JSON comparator.
    - Move parsing to JSONFile.recognizes
    - Ensure decode errors in JSON comparator are not fatal.
  * Ignore /.*eggs and /.cache - they get created when running tests.
  * Reflow long dh_python3 call in debian/rules.
  * Use dict.get fallback to shorten OS_NAMES lookup in --list-tools.
  * --list-tools:
    - Output --list-tools in RFC822 format to make parsing less brittle.
    - Print "no package mapping" in --list-tools to stderr, not stdout.
    - Remove unused ``reduce`` import.
    - Reflow long PROVIDERS lookup.
  * Add .travis.yml from http://travis.debian.net/
  * Don't skip squashfs test_listing test; we can workaround it, as long as we
    have a uid 1000.
  * Drop "Testsuite: autopkgtest" in debian/control; it is added automatically
    by dpkg-source version 1.17.11.

  [Mattia Rizzolo]
  * autopkgtest: be more verbose when running the tests
  * debian/control:
    - Mark build-dependency needed only for tests with a <!nocheck> build
      profile (reverted as they break dh-python)
    - add more build-dependencies to be able to run more tests at build time
    - default-jdk-headless is enough to have javap, instead of all of
      default-jdk
  * debian/rules:
    - be more verbose when running the tests, in particular, show why tests are
      being skipped
    - teach pybuild where to put diffoscope's files
  * do not try to execute the command if the command is not available

  [Ximin Luo]

  * Analyze md5sums file in .deb before working on data.tar. This makes
    the code more robust and is required to properly skip files listed as
    identical in md5sums while doing parallel processing.
  * Add support for package names for OS other than Debian. The --list-tools
    command-line option now supports an optional argument to display a given
